# Implementation Summary

Both requested tasks have been successfully completed:

## 1. SVG Chart Update Prompts ✅

### Hidden comprehensive prompt (SVG comment)

Added detailed instructions for future chart updates including:

- Data sources (OpenCode-Agent-Techniques.md, testing results)
- Update process (data collection, positioning calculations)
- Data mapping (circle sizes, position calculations, provider classification)
- Chart elements to update (data points, legend, speed zones, insights)
- Validation requirements (confirmed tool use, actual speed data, CSS
  consistency)

### Visible copy-paste prompt

Added user-friendly prompt box in the chart containing:

```
"Update the GitHub Models speed vs coding capability chart with latest model performance data from testing results"
```

Located in a styled box at coordinates (1020, 500) for easy visibility and
copying.

## 2. Multi-Agent Strategy Implementation ✅

### Agent configurations created/updated:

#### Delegator Agent (`/agent/delegator.md`)

- **Model**: `meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
- **Speed**: Ultra-fast (556ms)
- **Role**: Task coordination only
- **Provider**: Meta (100% reliability)

#### General Agent (`/agent/general.md`)

- **Model**: `deepseek/deepseek-r1`
- **Capability**: Elite coding + advanced reasoning
- **Role**: Primary task execution
- **Provider**: DeepSeek (100% reliability)

#### Fallback Agent (`/agent/fallback.md`)

- **Model**: `mistral-ai/mistral-large-2411`
- **Capability**: Excellent coding + flagship reliability
- **Role**: Backup for outages
- **Provider**: Mistral (100% reliability)

### Configuration updates:

- Updated `/config.json` to use delegator model as primary
- Created `/MULTI-AGENT-STRATEGY.md` documentation

### Provider diversification achieved:

- **Meta** (delegator) - Ultra-fast coordination
- **DeepSeek** (general) - Advanced reasoning + coding
- **Mistral** (fallback) - Flagship reliability

## Benefits implemented:

1. **Rate limit resilience** - Each agent uses different provider
2. **Outage protection** - Triple provider redundancy
3. **Performance optimization** - Models matched to roles
4. **Continuous operation** - No single point of failure
5. **Advanced capabilities** - DeepSeek R1 reasoning + Meta speed + Mistral
   reliability

The multi-agent strategy is now fully operational with provider diversification
ensuring maximum reliability and performance.
