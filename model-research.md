## Latest Research Updates (Cycle 3)

### Current Status - October 2, 2025

**Rate Limit Status**: ⚠️ **GLOBAL BACKOFF ACTIVE**\
**Remaining Time**: 1036 minutes (17+ hours)\
**Next Testing Window**: October 3, 2025 1:08 AM\
**Last Successful Cycle**: Cycle 3 - Completed with 4 models tested

**Trigger Event**: OpenAI gpt-5 rate limit enforcement (10 requests/24 hours
limit)

The autonomous testing system hit the severe gpt-5 rate limits which triggered a
global backoff period. This demonstrates the importance of conservative testing
strategies when dealing with heavily restricted models.

**Scheduled Actions for Next Window**:

1. Resume testing of OpenAI o1 series (o1, o1-mini, o1-preview)
2. Test OpenAI o3 series (o3, o3-mini, o4-mini)
3. Retry Anthropic Claude models with potential auth fixes
4. Continue systematic testing of remaining 61 untested models

**Strategy**:

- Continue conservative testing approach
- Document rate limit patterns for each provider
- Focus on development-practical models
- Map tool use capabilities systematically

## Security & Best Practices

### Rate Limit Respect

- Conservative sleep periods between cycles (2→3→4+ hours)
- Small batch sizes (3-4 models maximum)
- Immediate stop on rate limit detection
- Exponential backoff for recovery

### Authentication Security

- Programmatic token retrieval only
- No token exposure in logs or outputs
- Minimal required permissions
- State persistence for continuity

**Research Methodology**: Autonomous polling with exponential backoff,
conservative batch testing, comprehensive documentation of capabilities and
limitations.
